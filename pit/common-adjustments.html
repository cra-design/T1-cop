<p>If you lived, on a permanent basis, in a prescribed northern zone or in a prescribed intermediate zone&nbsp;for a continuous period of at least <span class="nowrap">six months</span>, you may be able to claim the northern residents deductions. This period can begin or end in the tax year.</p>
<p>There are two deductions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>residency deduction</strong> for having lived in a prescribed zone</li>
<li>a <strong>travel deduction </strong>for taxable benefits received from your employer (if any) that was included in your income <strong>or</strong> the portion of the $1,200 standard amount for the person travelling (you or your eligible family member) that was allocated to the trip</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2021 and later tax years, you will be able to claim a travel deduction for your or your eligible family member's personal travel, even if neither you nor your eligible family member(s) received a taxable travel benefit for that trip.</p>
<p>For 2022 and later tax years, please see the Simplified Northern Resident Travel Deduction (SNRTD) pilot project at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-25500-northern-residents-deductions/line-25500-much-you-claim-a-deduction-travel-benefits/line-25500-lowest-return-airfare-table.html">canada.ca/lowest-return-airfare</a> for a simpler way to get the lowest return airfare to use on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2222.html">Form T2222, Northern Residents Deductions</a>.</p>
<p>An <strong>eligible family member</strong> is someone who lived with you at the time of the trip and was one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>your spouse or common-law partner&nbsp;</li>
<li>your or your spouse’s or common-law partner’s child under the age of 18&nbsp;</li>
<li>another individual who is wholly dependent for support on you, your spouse or common-law partner, or both, and who is either:&nbsp;<ul>
<li>your or your spouse’s or common-law partner’s parent or grandparent&nbsp;</li>
<li>related to you and wholly dependent by reason of mental or physical infirmity</li>

        <h2>Amount for an eligible dependant - <span class="nowrap">Line 30400</span> of the return (previously line&nbsp;305 of Schedule&nbsp;1)</h2>
<p>If you were not married or living common-law at any time in the year and were supporting a dependant who was living in your home, you may be able to claim the amount for an eligible dependant at <span class="nowrap">line 30400 (previously line 305)</span>.</p>
<p>If you are claiming an amount for an eligible dependant, you must send <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s5.html">Schedule 5, Amounts for Spouse or Common-Law Partner and Dependants</a>, with your paper return. If you are filing online, have the Schedule 5 completed and ready to send to us if we ask for it.</p>
<p>If you claim this amount for a child under the age of 18, we may ask you to send us proof that you have custody of the child. In a shared custody situation where both parents are eligible to claim the dependant, you both will have to agree on who will make the claim. If you can't agree, neither of you can claim the credit.</p>
<p>As custody arrangements can change, you should send the information we are asking for even if you have sent similar information for another year.</p>
<p>If you had to make support payments for the child being claimed, you are not eligible to claim the amount on <span class="nowrap">line 30400 (previously line 305)</span>. For more information on child support obligations and claiming an eligible dependant, see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/support-payments/shared-custody-amount-eligible-dependant.html">Child custody and the amount for an eligible dependant</a>.</p>
<p>If you claim this amount for a child over 18 years of age, they <strong>have to</strong> be dependent on you because of an impairment in their physical or mental functions. We may ask for a signed statement from a medical practitioner showing when the impairment began and what the duration of the impairment is expected to be.</p>
<p>You do not need a signed statement from a medical practitioner if the CRA already has an approved Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate, for a specified period. For more information, see line 30500.</p>
<p>If you claim this amount for a parent or grandparent, you may be asked to send us proof that they depend on you for support.</p>

<p>If the eligible dependant you claimed at <span class="nowrap">line 30400 (previously line 305) </span>was <span class="nowrap">18 years </span>of age or older and dependant on you because of an impairment in physical or mental functions, you may be able to claim the Canada caregiver amount for your eligible dependant at <span class="nowrap">line 51100 (previously line 5110)&nbsp;</span>of <span class="nowrap">Schedule 5</span>.</p>
<p>We may ask for a signed statement from a medical practitioner showing when the impairment began and what the duration of the impairment is expected to be.</p>
<p>If the eligible dependant you claimed at line 30400 (previously line 305) is your or your spouse's or common-law partner's infirm child under 18 years of age, you have to claim the Canada caregiver amount for the dependant at line 30500 on the tax return (previously line 367 of Schedule 1), Canada caregiver amount for infirm children under 18 years of age, and not at line 51100 (previously line 5110) on Schedule 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may ask for a signed statement from a medical practitioner showing when the impairment began and what the duration of the impairment is expected to be. For children under 18 years of age, the statement should also show that the child, because of the impairment in physical or mental functions, is, and will likely continue to be, dependent on others for an indefinite duration. Dependent on others means they need much more assistance for their personal needs and care compared to children of the same age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not need a signed statement from a medical practitioner if the CRA already has an approved Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate, for a specified period.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>If you have not received or have lost your current year's tax slip(s), you have to ask the issuer of the slip for a copy.</p> 
        <p>What you need to know about tax information slips:</p> 
        <ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg"> 
            <li>Tax slips are prepared by the issuer using information from their files. So, if there is an error on your slip or if you have any questions about an amount on a slip, contact the issuer.</li> 
            <li>The Canada Revenue Agency will not put tax slip information on My Account unless the social insurance number (SIN) is valid and matches the name we have on file for you. Validating the SIN and name may take some time after the slip is filed.</li> 
            <li>Sometimes you will not be able to view certain tax slips on My Account; for example, it might take longer to see late or amended tax slips.</li>

        <h3 id="h_1_7">Uncashed cheques</h3> 
        <p>You can click this link to see if you have any uncashed cheques from the CRA.</p> 
        <p>If you have uncashed cheques, a table will be displayed indicating each uncashed cheque you have with the payment date, payment type, dollar amount, reference number, and a link to download Form PWGSC 535.</p> 
        <p>If you still have the original cheques listed in the table, you can cash them at any Canadian financial institution. Government cheques do not expire. If you no longer have the cheques, you can ask for a duplicate payment.</p> 
        <p>To request a duplicate payment, you will need to download Form PWGSC 535, print it, fill it out, and submit the completed form to the CRA through the submit documents feature in My Account or mail it to the Sudbury Tax Centre.</p> 
        <p>Detailed instructions on how to request a duplicate payment are on the “Uncashed cheques” page in My Account.</p> 
        <p>If you do not have any uncashed cheques a message will be displayed saying you have no uncashed cheques.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_1_8">My Service Canada Account</h3> 
        <p>You can use this link to transfer to Employment and Social Development Canada’s (ESDC) My Service Canada Account without needing to sign in again.</p> 
        <p>You will need to select <strong>I agree</strong> to confirm your consent to allow the CRA to provide your social insurance number (SIN) to ESDC before transferring you to My Service Canada Account through a secure connection. Your SIN will be used solely for the purposes of ESDC identifying you and displaying your information to you on My Service Canada Account, and for no other purposes.</p> 
        <p>If you select <strong>I do not agree</strong>, you will be returned to the CRA’s My Account.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_1_9">Tax schemes</h3> 
        <p>Tax schemes are plans and arrangements that attempt to deceive taxpayers by promising to reduce the taxes they owe, either through large deductions, or through promising tax free income. Schemes can also include other creative ways to convince people to pay less than what they owe.

        <p>The Change my return service allows you to make changes to your income tax and benefit return(s) for the current year and nine prior years. You can use it after you’ve received your notice of assessment or notice of reassessment.</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>To begin the process, select the year you want to change from a list of available years. As certain restrictions apply, you may receive a message stating that you cannot use the service. A maximum of ten returns can be changed.</li> 
            <li>The T1 General electronic form follows the format of the T1 General Income Tax and Benefit paper return by providing tabs at the top of the screen that represent the sections of the return.</li> 
            <li>The Search tab allows you to search T1 lines by description or line number.</li> 
            <li>Select the line that you wish to adjust and enter the new amount for that line.</li> 
            <li>Make sure to review the changes and make any corrections necessary before submitting them to us.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>You will receive a confirmation number even if there is a delay to the processing of your request. Generally, you will either be contacted for more information or receive a Notice of Reassessment within two weeks for each return submitted.</p> 
        <p>A confirmation number is also provided when your request is to be processed within two weeks. You will be presented with a summary of changes and tax difference information.</p> 
        <h4>What does the tax difference information include?</h4> 
        <p>When the CRA calculates your income tax return after a change is made there is usually a tax difference. When the total payable is less than your total credits there is a refund (displays as a negative amount), when the total payable is more than your total credits there is a debit (displays as a positive amount). The tax difference may differ from the amount on your notice of reassessment. Detailed explanations of any changes made to your return are provided in your notice of reassessment.</p> 
        <p>Although you may be entitled to a refund for a particular year, we may have kept some or all of it to:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>apply against any amount you owe us or are about to owe us;</li> 
            <li>apply against certain other outstanding federal, provincial, or territorial government debts such as student loans, Employment Insurance and social assistance benefit overpayments, Immigration loans, and training allowance overpayments; or</li> 
            <li>satisfy a garnishment order under the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>If you need more information, please see your notice of reassessment. It explains how your refund was disbursed. The notice also provides telephone numbers to call to speak to a program representative.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_3_6">Proof of income statement</h3> 
        <p>The "Proof of income statement" service allows you to view and print a <strong>Proof of income statement</strong>, based on your tax return Notice of assessment (or most recent notice of reassessment). This statement can be printed and used when proof of your income is required, such as at your financial institution or when applying for government programs.</p> 
        <p>You can select a <strong>Proof of income statement</strong> for any of the last three tax years, as long as those returns have been assessed.</p> 
        <p>Follow these steps:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>On the "Proof of income statement" page, select the tax year for your statement using the drop-down menu (you can only select one tax year at a time), then click Search.</li> 
            <li>A new screen will appear, displaying a printer-friendly copy of your statement for the selected tax year.</li> 
            <li>You can now print the statement by clicking the <strong>Print/Save</strong> button at the top of the screen, or from your internet browser’s print option.</li> 
            <li>You can repeat the process for each desired tax year.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>This will be a multi-page print, with the number of pages depending on the length of the statement.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_3_7">File a GST/HST rebate</h3>

        <h3 id="pay.1c">Make an online request</h3> 
        <p>This section allows you to make requests for online services that the CRA will process. The CRA will issue a reference number once your request is accepted for processing. Keep the reference number for your records.</p>
        <p>You can make the following requests online:</p>
       <h4 class="h5">Payment transfer</h4>
        <p>Use this option to request the transfer of an available payment or an instalment payment to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a tax balance owing</li>

            <li>a benefits balance owing (for goods and services tax credit (GSTC), Canada child benefit (CCB), Ontario trillium benefit (OTB), or other)</li>
            <li>another government department (for employment insurance (EI), old age security (OAS), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Canada Student Loans (CSL), or other)</li>
            <li>a business account</li>
            <li>another individual account (for example, spouse)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="h5">Refund</h4>
        <p>Use this option to request the refund of an available payment or an instalment payment.</p>
        

        <h3 id="h_4_2">Statement of account</h3> 
        <p>The statement of account shows the transactions that have occurred on your personal tax account for the period beginning with the start of the prior calendar year, including assessments, reassessments, payments, and any interest charged. It also shows your current account balance.</p> 
        <p>The date shown near the top of this page is usually today's date. However, if an assessment or reassessment has been processed to your account with an effective date later than the current date, that date will be shown.</p> 
        <p>If you have questions about the statement, call the Canada Revenue Agency. If you are in Canada or the United States, call <span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-8281</strong></span>. From outside Canada or the United States call <span class="nowrap"><strong>613-940-8495</strong></span>. We accept collect calls.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_4_4">Payments made on filing</h3> 
        <p>When you submit a return with a balance owing (your total payable is more than your total credits), you can pay in several different ways:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>by using your financial institution's online banking services;</li> 
            <li>by using the My Payment option;</li> 
            <li>by setting up a pre-authorized debit agreement; or</li> 
            <li>by making a payment at your financial institution.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>If the payment is processed before your return is assessed, it is called a payment made on filing, and it will appear on your notice of assessment. If not, we will apply the payment to your account on the date of the payment and then send you a revised statement of your account.</p> 
        <p>Please note that it could take a few days to process your payment.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_4_5">Instalments</h3> 
        <h4>Instalment payment summary</h4> 
        <p>This section shows, for the years listed, the total instalment payments we received from you. These payments appear only for returns that have not yet been assessed and only until they are applied to the amount owing on a specific return.</p> 
        <p>The <strong>Proceed to pay</strong> button allows you to <strong>pay now, pay later, or pay in person</strong>.</p> 
        <h4>Instalment reminders</h4> 
        <p>If we mailed you any instalment reminders this year or last year, a chart will be displayed showing the mailing dates of the instalment reminders, the payment due dates from box 1, and the corresponding amounts from box 2 on each instalment reminder. You can select a mailing date to view more information from that instalment reminder, if your return for that tax year has not yet been assessed.</p> 
        <p>Every February and August, we send instalment reminders to individuals who may have to pay tax by instalments. The February reminder covers payments due on March&nbsp;15 and on June&nbsp;15, and the August reminder covers payments due on September&nbsp;15 and December&nbsp;15. In November, we send an instalment reminder to farmers and fishers for the payment due on December&nbsp;31.</p> 
        <p>Current year instalments are payments you make throughout the year to cover the taxes you normally pay in one lump sum on April 30 of the following year. You pay these instalments during the year while you are earning the income, similar to how an employer deducts tax directly from each pay period. Most taxpayers have an adequate amount of tax automatically deducted from their salary throughout the year. However, income received at various times during the year, such as pension or investment income, is not always subject to proper withholding tax.</p> 
        <h4>Request a remittance voucher to use at your bank</h4> 
        <p>You need a remittance voucher to make a payment at a financial institution. Remittance vouchers contain special magnetic ink for processing at financial institutions. You can request remittance vouchers using the “Request a remittance voucher” service and the remittance voucher will automatically be mailed to you. You can also request a remittance voucher by using our Interactive Voice Response service (IVR) at <span class="nowrap">1-800-959-8281</span> and the remittance voucher will automatically be mailed to you.</p> 
        <p>For information on other ways to make a payment, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/cra-portal/exit.html">Tax payments</a>.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_4_6">Pre-authorized debit</h3> 
        <p>Pre-authorized Debit (PAD) is an online self-service payment option that allows you to initiate an agreement that authorizes the CRA to withdraw a pre-determined payment amount directly from your bank account on pre-determined date(s) to pay your tax obligations.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_4_7">Uncashed cheques</h3> 
        <p>You can click this link to see if you have any uncashed cheques from the CRA.</p> 
        <p>If you have uncashed cheques, a table will be displayed indicating each uncashed cheque you have with the payment date, payment type, dollar amount, reference number, and a link to download Form PWGSC 535.</p> 
        <p>If you still have the original cheques listed in the table, you can cash them at any Canadian financial institution. Government cheques do not expire. If you no longer have the cheques, you can ask for a duplicate payment.</p> 
        <p>To request a duplicate payment, you will need to download Form PWGSC 535, print it, fill it out, and submit the completed form to the CRA through the submit documents feature in My Account or mail it to the Sudbury Tax Centre.</p> 
        <p>Detailed instructions on how to request a duplicate payment are on the “Uncashed cheques” page in My Account.</p> 
        <p>If you do not have any uncashed cheques a message will be displayed saying you have no uncashed cheques.</p> 
        <h3 id="h_4_8">Request a remittance voucher</h3> 
        <p>The "Request a remittance voucher" service allows you to order personalized remittance vouchers, which you can use to make payments for a tax balance owing, payment on filing, or quarterly instalments, at a financial institution, or by mail along with a cheque or money order. Once you make your request, we will mail the remittance voucher (s) to you within 10 to 14 business days.</p> 
        <p>Note that you cannot print these remittance vouchers from the CRA website as they require special magnetic ink to be processed by financial institutions. We must mail these vouchers to you.</p> 
        <p>You can order the following types of remittance vouchers:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>T7DR - to make a payment for a tax balance owing (we will send you two T7DRs in one envelope)</li> 
            <li>INNS3 - to make a quarterly instalment payment (we will send you two INNS3s in one envelope)</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>Request remittance vouchers by taking the following steps:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>On the "Request a remittance voucher" screen, click <strong>Start</strong> and then select the remittance voucher you want (you can only select one remittance voucher type at a time), then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li> 
            <li>If the remittance voucher shown is correct, click <strong>Submit</strong>. If you would like to request another remittance voucher, or a different remittance voucher type, click <strong>Back</strong>.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>Please allow 10 to 14 business days to receive your voucher(s).</p> 
        <h3 id="h_4_9">Request relief of penalties and interest</h3> 
        <p>You can use the Request relief of penalties and interest service to ask us to cancel penalty and interest amounts charged to your account.</p> 
        <p>The service will take you through several pages asking you for details about your request, providing instructions as you navigate each page.</p> 
        <p>After completing your request and selecting the <strong>Submit</strong> button, you will be taken to a confirmation page. Print or save a copy of this page for your records. It is recommended that you submit any supporting documentation at this time, using our Submit documents service. When submitting documents, use the case number provided on the confirmation page.</p> 
        <p>You will be notified once a preliminary review of your request is completed.</p>

<p>A <strong>notice of assessment (NOA)</strong> is the summary of the calculated amounts for your income tax and benefit return.

		<dt>In tax software</dt>

			<p>You will have the option to view your notice in tax software immediately after you send the tax return to the CRA.</p>

<h3>When you will receive your notice</h3>
	<p>The method you use to file a tax return affects how long it takes to receive your NOA. </p>
	<ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="far fa-clock fa-li"></span><strong>Processing time:</strong>
     <ul>
	     <li>Within 2 weeks if you filed electronically</li>
	     <li>Within 8 weeks if you filed by paper</li>
     </ul>
      </li></ul>	
<details class="mrgn-tp-lg">
	<summary>Why a NOA may take longer to issue</summary>
	  <p>It may take longer to issue a notice of assessment (NOA) if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You filed your return after the due date</li>
    <li>CRA completes a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra.html">review of your tax return</a></li>
    <li>Your tax filing situation includes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple tax returns</li>
      <li>A bankruptcy return</li>
      <li>A deceased taxpayer return</li>
      <li>A request from the CRA to you or your authorized representative for more information or documents</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Non-resident tax returns may take up to 16 weeks to process.</p>

  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">For details, refer to: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/T1-cop/pit/check-cra-processing-times.html">CRA processing times</a></p>

</details>	
<details>
  <summary>How long it takes to issue a NOR after changes are made to a tax return</summary>
	<p>Generally, the processing time is the same for issuing a notice of reassessment (NOR).</p>
<p>If you make changes to your tax return after you have filed it, refer to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/T1-cop/pit/change-your-return.html#how">how long it takes to process your adjustment request</a>.</p>
<p>If the CRA found errors on the tax return you filed, you will receive your NOR right after our reassessment is complete.</p>

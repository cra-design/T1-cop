<p>Use the steps below as a guide to help you complete your tax return electronically with certified tax software. </p>
<p>Since each software option is different, you may need to follow the instructions in the software you selected.</p>

	
  <details>
    <summary>If you are filing a tax return for someone else</summary>
    <p>You <strong>must</strong> be registered for Represent a Client to manage and have access to someone else's tax information.</p>
	  <p>Once registered, you will get a RepID that you can share with family or friends, so they can authorize you as their representative.</p>
    <p>For details, refer to: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization.html">Representative authorization</a></p>

		    <h2>Check your CRA information and preferences</h2>
		     <p>Make sure your details with the CRA are up-to-date.</p>
	  <p>If your circumstances have changed, you need to notify the CRA. Allow time for the CRA to process these changes before sending your tax return.</p>
		    <p>Change or confirm your:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Direct deposit information</li>
			  <li>Mailing address</li>
			
			  <li>Notification preferences (online mail or letter mail)</li>
		  </ul>
	  <p>These changes cannot be completed within tax software. Find out your options to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/update-information-cra/personal.html">update your personal information with the CRA</a>.</p>

	      <li>
		      <h3>Enter personal information</h3>
		        <p>Fill in personal information such as name, address, and identification number (SIN, TTN, or ITN).</p>
	      </li>
	    <li>
		    <h3>Fill in your CRA information automatically (optional)</h3>
		    <p>In tax software, you can use the "Auto-fill my return" service to fill in available tax information the CRA has on file.</p>
<p>If you select this option, you will be prompted to enter your CRA account user ID and password.</p>
		    <p>For details: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/T1-cop/pit/sub-autofill.html">Auto-fill my return</a></p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
        <h3>Get the NETFILE access code</h3>
		    <p>If you chose to use the "Auto-fill my return" service, the access code will be automatically filled in. </p>
<p>If you are entering the information manually, you can find the <span class="nowrap">8-character</span> access code on the right side of the <strong>previous tax year's</strong> <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/T1-cop/pit/notice-assessment-understand.html">notice of assessment (NOA)</a>. You will not have an access code if you are filing a tax return for the first time.</p>

       <p>Entering the access code is <strong>not mandatory</strong>. </p>
		 <details>
	<summary>If you do not provide the access code</summary>
			 <p>Tax software can still electronically send the tax return to the CRA even if you don't provide the access code.</p>
	<p>While the access code is not mandatory, if you do not enter it:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You will not be able to use any information from your most recent tax return to confirm your identity with the CRA</li>
		<li>The CRA will have to use other information for authentication purposes</li>
	</ul>

			<h4>Check if all information is included</h4>
		<p>The CRA should receive most of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips.html">tax slips</a> and tax information from third parties by mid-March of each year.</p>
<p>If information is not available in your CRA account, we may not have yet received it. If you were issued a slip with errors in your personal information, it will not be available.</p>
		<p>You must contact the issuer if you are missing any tax slip information.</p>

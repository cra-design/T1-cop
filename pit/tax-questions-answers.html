  <li><strong>Canada Carbon Rebate (CCR) – now refers to what was formerly known as the Climate action incentive payment</strong><br>
  The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/cai-payment.html">CCR</a> is a tax-free amount paid to help individuals and families to offset the cost of federal pollution pricing. Individuals may be eligible for the CCR if they are a resident of one of the following provinces: Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Saskatchewan. The next CCR will be issued <span class="nowrap">April 15, 2024</span>. To get the payment on time individuals will need to file their 2023 income tax and benefit return by <span class="nowrap">March 15, 2024</span>.

  <p><strong>Check out our new podcast:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/cra-multimedia-library/podcasts.html">Taxology</a></p>
  <p>We simplify the world of taxes, since it can be confusing! We’ll help you understand Canadian taxes, including how to prepare for tax season, explain different savings accounts to help kick-start your savings, and introduce listeners to the platform economy.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">Changes to the T1 notice of assessment</h3>
  <p>The CRA has made changes to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/notice-assessment-understand.html">T1 notice of assessment</a> and notice of reassessment to make the information it contains easier to understand and to provide more complete information. For example, the CRA has recently released an updated version of the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) table. This new version includes additional information and clear calculations. Notices will also contain a similar table for the new First Home Savings Account (FHSA) when applicable.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">Delivery of the cheque notice</h3>
  <p>Due to changes in the production of the cheque notice, individuals who are expecting a refund and are <strong>not</strong> signed up for direct deposit will receive their paper T1 notice of assessment and cheque separately. Sign up for direct deposit to avoid waiting for a cheque in the mail. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">canada.ca/direct-deposit</a>.</p>

  <li><strong>Advanced Canada workers benefit (ACWB) payments sent automatically</strong><br>
  You don't need to apply to receive the ACWB payments. The CRA will determine your eligibility for the Canada workers benefit (CWB) when you file your income tax and benefit return. If you received the CWB in the previous tax year, the CRA will automatically send you ACWB payments.

Qualifying expenditures of up to $20,000, for a tax credit of up to $3,000 may be claimed.

This service is free, secure, and easy to use. There are no paper forms to fill out or calculations to do. Individuals do not need to speak to an agent to use this service. Eligible individuals will receive a personalized invitation letter in the mail.</p>
  <p>Residents of Quebec will still need to complete the Quebec provincial tax return with <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/">Revenu Québec</a>, as SimpleFile by Phone only completes the federal portion of their tax return.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">Filing on paper</h3>
  <p>The 2023 income tax and benefit package was sent to paper filers who filed their 2022 income tax and benefit return on paper. The package should have arrived by <span class="nowrap">February 19, 2024</span>.</p>

  <p>If you did not receive it by <span class="nowrap">February 19</span>, you can:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>view, download, and print the package from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">canada.ca/taxes-general-package</a></li>
  <li>order it online at <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/cjcf/fpos-scfp/pub/rdr?request_locale=en_CA">canada.ca/get-cra-forms</a></li>
  <li>order a package by calling the CRA at <span class="nowrap">1-855-330-3305</span> (be ready to give your social insurance number)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can order or download the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package.html">2023 income tax package</a> as of <span class="nowrap"><strong>January 23, 2024</strong></span>.</p>

  <p>If you need to order a package, please keep in mind that it may take up to 10 days for the package to arrive by mail. You need to factor that time in, so you don’t miss the filing deadline.</p>

  <section class="alert alert-info">
  <p class="h4">Note: Why is the 2023 Income tax package thinner than usual?</p>
  <p>Starting in 2024, the CRA will no longer print line-by-line instructions in the paper package.</p>
  <p>The CRA made this change after hearing feedback from individuals who file on paper. The majority of these individuals confirmed that they rarely use the line-by-line instructions when filing. Instead, they indicated that they rely on information from prior year returns and the “What’s New” section of the income tax package. By making this change, the CRA will reduce each paper package by approximately 30 pages, or about 20%. This also supports the CRA’s commitment to sustainable development and the government's efforts to go green.</p>
  <p>The updated income tax package will contain information and forms paper filers need to file their income tax and benefit returns.</p>
  </section>

  <h3 class="h4">Using Simple File: Let us help you get your benefits!</h3>
  <p>Individuals with a modest income and a simple tax situation may be able to use the CRA’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/indigenous-peoples/credit-benefit-short-return.html">Simple File: Let us help you get your benefits!</a> simplified paper return. These returns are available through Northern Service Centres, band councils offices, and Friendship Centres and cannot be downloaded. Individuals are encouraged to check with their local office to get a paper copy.</p>

  <p>Individuals may be able to use this simplified return if their taxable income is less than the basic income threshold for the province or territory in which they reside. The information provided on the simplified return will help the CRA calculate which payments the individual is eligible for, such as the Canada child benefit (CCB), the goods and service tax / harmonized sales tax credit (GST/HST credit), and other credits and benefits, as well as related provincial and territorial programs.</p>

  <p>You need to verify that the CRA has your correct information on file, including your current address, to avoid delays in receiving your notice of assessment.

Parents and guardians can apply if the child receiving dental care, in Canada, is younger than 12 years old and does not have access to a private dental insurance plan. Children already covered by another dental program provided by any level of government may still be eligible for the Canada Dental Benefit if their dental care costs are not fully covered by these other programs. Depending on adjusted family net income, a tax-free payment of $260, $390, or $650 is available for each eligible child.

        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>The CRA is making it easier for individuals to get the help they need over the phone. This includes increasing the number of available agents and extending hours of operation.</p>

  <p>The CRA’s individual enquiries line is open 12 hours per day (from <span class="nowrap">8:00 a.m.</span> to <span class="nowrap">8:00 p.m.</span> Local Time) on weekdays and from <span class="nowrap">9:00 a.m.</span> to <span class="nowrap">5:00 p.m.</span> (Local Time) on Saturdays, excluding holidays.

    <h2>What are the most common mistakes people make on their income tax and benefit return?</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>25. What are the most common errors?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>Everyone makes mistakes. If you make a mistake on your income tax and benefit return, it can take longer for us to review your return and it may prevent you from getting any tax refund, credit or benefit on a timely basis. Mistakes can also lead to a higher chance of a review or an audit of your return.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">To help you avoid mistakes, below is a list of common errors that we see:</h3>
  <p><strong>Not reporting all income</strong> – Make sure you report your income from all sources, including:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>tips and gratuities</li>
  <li>temporary jobs</li>
  <li>part-time jobs</li>
  <li>income from sales of goods or services if you are carrying on a business (such as side jobs)</li>
  <li>income from the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/platform-economy.html">platform economy</a> which includes ridesharing, accommodation sharing, gigs, peer-to-peer sales and social media activities on digital platforms </li>
  <li>income from online business activities</li>
  <li>foreign income (including interest and other income from investments held outside Canada)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a Canadian resident, you are subject to Canadian income tax on your worldwide income from all sources. You should report all the income you earn (both monetary and non-monetary), whether you receive it in cash or merchandise, or if it’s reported as income on your T4 or other tax slips. You should receive most of your slips from your employer, payer, or administrator by the end of February.</p>

  <p>If you have not received a slip or if you have lost or misplaced one, you should ask the issuer for a copy. To avoid delays, you can also view most slips and tax information online through <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. Register or sign-in before tax season to make sure you have access and confirm your personal information.</p>

  <p><strong>Not supporting business income and expense claims</strong> – if you are a sole proprietor or self-employed, make sure you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/business-records.html">keep good records</a> to support your business income and expenses. Reconciling the income recorded in your books to independent sources including bank statements and statements of earnings from other sources such as digital platforms can help to ensure the accuracy of your records. If we audit your income tax and benefit return, having good records on hand will make the process faster and easier.</p>

  <p><strong>Not keeping personal information up-to-date</strong> – it is important to tell us as soon as possible about any change in your address, direct deposit details, or marital status (required by law). This helps avoid any disruption to your refund and benefit or credit payments.</p>

  <p><strong>Personal expenses</strong> – you cannot deduct expenses that are personal to you from your income. Examples of these non-deductible amounts include funeral and wedding expenses, loans to family members, and any loss on the sale of personal-use property like a principal residence or an automobile. If we find a mistake or a claim that does not apply to your situation, we will adjust your income tax and benefit return accordingly.</p>

  <p><strong>Writing the amount of your partial payment on your paper return</strong> – if you are paying only part of your balance owing, do not write this amount on your paper return. The payment you send with your income tax and benefit return will be counted as a payment towards your tax return balance. It will then show as a <strong>payment on filing</strong> on your notice of assessment.</p>

  <p>An individual, other than a trust, does not have to file Form T1135 for the year in which the individual first becomes a resident of Canada.</p>

  <p>Form T1135 must be filed on or before the due date of your income tax and benefit return or, in the case of a partnership, the due date of the partnership information return, even if the income tax and benefit return or partnership information return is not required to be filed.</p>

  <p><strong>Filing</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1135.html">Form T1135, Foreign Income Verification Statement</a> <strong>late</strong> – All Canadian resident taxpayers, including non-resident trusts deemed resident in Canada according to the Income Tax Act (ITA), are required to file Form T1135, Foreign Income Verification Statement, if at any time in the year the total cost amount of all specified foreign property to the taxpayer was more than $100,000 (Canadian).</p>

  <p>There are large penalties for failing to complete and file Form T1135 accurately and on time. For more information about penalties, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/foreign-reporting/table-penalties.html">see the table of penalties on the CRA website</a>.</p>

        <summary>26. Is the Voluntary Disclosures Program available for taxpayers to fix errors or omissions in their tax filings, including the T1135?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>Yes. If you did not file <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1135.html">Form T1135</a> or if the information you provided is incomplete, the CRA encourages you to come forward and correct inaccurate or incomplete information, or to disclose information not previously reported through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/voluntary-disclosures-program.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP)</a>. If the CRA accepts your application, you will receive prosecution relief, and in some cases, penalty relief and partial interest relief that you would have otherwise needed to pay.</p>

  <p>The VDP is also available for all taxpayers who would like to disclose information they did not report or correct information they already submitted, as long as they meet certain conditions.</p>

  <details>
        <summary>29. What are email notifications from the CRA?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>This service lets you receive email notifications from the CRA when important changes are made on your account and when you have mail to view in My Account.</p>

  <p>We take the protection of Canadians’ tax information very seriously. To better protect you and your personal information we require that you provide your email address to use <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>, as an extra layer of security. Through an email notification, the CRA will notify you of important information, including if your address or direct deposit information has been changed on CRA records. Email notifications from the CRA will never include hyperlinks or ask you to provide information. If you receive a CRA email notification that seems suspicious or about a change that you did not authorize, you should <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud.html#h3_1">contact the CRA</a> as soon as possible.</p>

        <summary>30. Do I have to receive email notifications?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a> users are required to have an email address on file with the CRA to help protect their accounts from fraudulent activity. This security feature ensures that you receive email notifications when important changes are made to your account.</p>

  <p>While some email notifications are mandatory to ensure the security of your account, such as when address or direct deposit information is changed, you are able to choose to receive additional optional notifications, such as when you have uncashed cheques.</p>

  <p>This security feature will not affect your preferred method of receiving CRA mail. You will have the option to receive paper mail delivery or an email notification when there is new mail to view in My Account. To receive email notifications when there is new mail to view in My Account and to stop receiving paper mail through Canada Post, you must set your correspondence preferences to “Electronic mail.”</p>

        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>The CRA will never use aggressive language or tone, ask for prepaid credit cards, threaten arrest, or threaten to send police. A CRA email notification will only advise you that you have mail to view in My Account or that important information was changed on CRA records. A notification will never ask you to confirm information or click on a link.

        <summary>32. Are the CRA’s digital services safe?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>Our digital services use a high level of online protection, to keep your personal information safe.</p>

  <p>To ensure that Canadians can feel confident using our digital services, we have added some new security measures. These measures include captcha, which helps distinguish between human users and bots when sign-in information is entered into the CRA’s online portals. A captcha requires you to enter specific characters or identify specific images before you can access our CRA sign-in services.</p>

  <p>As well, we now use Multi-factor authentication for all users to help make our CRA sign-in services more secure! To ensure everyone can use it, we have a telephone, a passcode grid, or a third-party authenticator app option. Learn more at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/help-cra-sign-in-services/multi-factor-authentication.html">Multi-factor authentication to access CRA sign-in services</a>.</p>

  <p>We also have an optional, additional security measure that allows you to set a unique personal identification number (PIN) for your account so you can identify yourself quickly and securely on the phone with the CRA. You can create your PIN in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>

  <p>We also encourage Canadians to help protect their personal information and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/account-security.html#h_4">prevent security incidents</a> by using a unique and strong password for each online account. Do not reuse the same password for different systems and applications, and regularly monitor all your online accounts for suspicious activity.</p>

  <p>As an additional security measure, all My Account users must have an email address on file. This service notifies you by email if important information, including your address or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/direct-deposit.html">direct deposit</a> information, has been changed on our records. If you notice changes to your CRA account information that you did not request, or if you think your information has been compromised, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud.html#h3_1">report it to the CRA by contacting us</a>. You can also contact us through the individual tax enquiries line at <span class="nowrap">1-800-959-8281</span> and select the option “report suspected fraud or identity theft” to speak to a specialized agent as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The CRA understands that you may not be able to meet your tax obligations because of circumstances beyond your control. We have improved the payment options available in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Account and My Business Account</a> by integrating the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/payments-cra/payment-arrangements.html">Payment Arrangement Calculator (PAC)</a> function in the “Schedule a series of payments” options in our secure portals.</p>

  <p>This allows individuals who cannot pay their debt right away, to set up a pre-authorized debit agreement without having to contact the CRA.

  <p>If you cannot pay the balance owing on or before <span class="nowrap">April 30, 2024</span>, you should still file your income tax and benefit return on time to avoid a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/interest-penalties.html">late-filing penalty</a> and any interest charges.</p>

        <summary>38. What happens if you file your income tax and benefit return late?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>If you have a balance owing for the year and do not file your income tax and benefit return on time, you will be charged a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/interest-penalties.html">late-filing penalty</a> and interest. The penalty is 5% of your balance owing that remained unpaid when the return was required to be filed, plus an additional 1% for each full month your return is late (up to a maximum of 12 months).<br>If the CRA charged you a late-filing penalty for 2020, 2021 or 2022 and requested a formal demand for a return, your late-filing penalty for 2023 will be <strong>10%</strong> of your balance owing. You will be charged an <strong>additional 2%</strong> for each full month that you file after the due date, to a maximum of 20 months.</p>

  <p>You should still file your income tax and benefit return even if you know you will have a balance owing that you cannot afford to pay right away.</p>

    <summary>39. Can you ask for relief from penalties and interest if you have been charged for filing or paying late?</summary>
    <div class="well well-sm">

  <p>The Minister may grant relief from penalties and interest when the following types of situations prevent a taxpayer from meeting their tax obligations:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>extraordinary circumstances</li>
  <li>actions of the CRA</li>
  <li>inability to pay or financial hardship</li>

  <h2>What should you do if you make a mistake on your income tax and benefit return?</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>40. Do you have to file another income tax and benefit return?</summary>
        <div class="well well-sm">
  <p>The CRA acknowledges that taxpayers may sometimes make honest mistakes when filing their taxes. The CRA has a list of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/review-your-tax-return-cra/common-adjustments.html">common adjustments</a> seen on income tax and benefit returns. To change an income tax and benefit return that has been filed, you can use the Change my return service in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>, or use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/refile-online-t1-adjustments-efile-service-providers.html">ReFILE</a> service in your certified tax software, or send changes by mail to a CRA tax centre.</p>

  <p>Generally, you can request a change to an income tax and benefit return for a tax year ending in any of the 10 previous calendar years. For example, a request made in 2024 must relate to the 2014 tax year or later.</p>

  <p>You can also check our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information/check-cra-processing-times.html">processing times tool</a> to get an estimate of how long it may take to process your request. After the CRA has processed your request, you will get a notice of reassessment, indicating the changes made to your return, or a letter explaining why the CRA did not make the changes you requested. With the ReFILE service, you can find out right away if your refund or amount owing has changed.</p>

<h2 id='review'>Review your balance owing</h2>  

<p>You can review your balance owing and explanation of changes on your notice of assessment (NOA) or notice of reassessment (NOR). Generally, you do <strong>not</strong> have to make a payment if your balance owing is <strong><span class="nowrap">$2 or less</span></strong>.</p>

<h3 id='updated'>Check your updated balance</h3>
<p>Your CRA account shows the most up-to-date balance owing, including all payments and balances across multiple years.</p>
<p>The amount from your CRA account may be different from your NOA or NOR, if you have:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Already paid but your notice was issued before the payment was received</li>  
<li>An unpaid balance from a previous year</li> 
</ul>  
<p>You can check your tax account balance online or by phone. Wait 3 business days for an online payment to process and 10 business days (plus mailing time) for a payment by cheque or money order.</p>
